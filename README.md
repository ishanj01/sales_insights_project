# Sales_insights_project

This project simulates a real-world data analysis scenario for a computer hardware company operating in a rapidly evolving market. The business was facing challenges in adapting to dynamic changes, prompting the sales director to initiate a data analysis project aimed at providing real-time sales insights. The goal was to build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that could support data-driven decision-making by visualizing key metrics and trends.

The project began with importing and analyzing data using SQL. Key analysis tasks included:

* Retrieving and displaying all customer records.
* Filtering transactions by market, with a focus on Chennai (market code Mark001).
* Identifying distinct product codes sold in specific markets.
* Filtering transactions conducted in US dollars.
* Analyzing transaction data for the year 2020 by joining the transactions and date tables.
* Calculating total revenue for 2020, as well as breaking down revenue by specific months (e.g., January) and markets (e.g., Chennai).

  
Once the SQL-based analysis was complete, the insights were brought to life in Power BI through interactive and dynamic dashboards. The dashboard allowed for real-time exploration of sales performance, market trends, and revenue breakdowns by time and region, providing valuable insights to the sales director. The use of custom DAX formulas and data visualizations helped present the findings in an intuitive way, empowering decision-makers to take strategic actions.
